# This package uses S4. If we use the package without attaching it (using `::`
# instead of `library`) some things may not work. This can only be changed by
# not using S4; which involves too much time and effort to get rid of at this
# point. Hence we have to make sure, that as soon something from this package is
# used, 'methods' is attached - simply importing it is not enough:
setLoadAction(function(ns) {
  eval(parse(text = "library('methods')"), envir = ns)
})
